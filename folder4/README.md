You will write a class that implements a contact book
entry. For example, my iPhone (and pretty much any smartphone) has a contacts
list app that allows you to store information about your friends, colleagues, and
businesses. In later assignments, you will have to implement this type of app (as a
command line program, of course.) For now, you will just have to implement the
building blocks for this app, namely, the Contact class.
